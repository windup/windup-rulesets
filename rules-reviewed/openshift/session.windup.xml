                       Session replication ensures that client sessions are not disrupted by failovers of nodes in a cluster.
                       Each node in the cluster shares information about ongoing sessions and can take over sessions if a node disappears.
                       The `<distributable/>` tag inside the `<web-app>` tag of application’s `web.xml` descriptor file enables the application's sessions clustering [1].

                       In a cloud environment it has to be considered that the data in the memory of a running container can be wiped out by a restart (triggered by code deploy, config change, or the execution environment relocating the process to a different physical location)[2].

                       Different approaches can be followed:

                       * review session replication's usage and make sure it is configured properly (effort 3) [3]
                       * rearchitect the application and consider storing sessions in a cache backing service (effort 7) [6][7][4][5]
                       * disable HTTP session clustering and accept its implications

                       The second approach (using a cache backing service) has some benefits:

                       * Increased application scalability and elasticity. By offloading the session data off to a remote Data Grid, the application tier itself can be more scalable and elastic.
                       * Session Persistence. By offloading session data to a remote data grid, the application itself will be able to survive EAP node failures since the a JVM failure will not cause the session data to be lost.
                       * Session Data Sharing. If you have a requirement for multiple applications to be able to share session data, this solution might be able to solve that use case as well.

                    The servlet container uses HttpSession to create a session between an HTTP client and an HTTP server.
                    The session persists for a specified time period, across more than one connection or page request from the user.
                    `HttpSession.setAttribute` method allows user information to persist across multiple user connections
                    Warning: As of Java Servlet Version 2.2, the `javax.http.HTTPSession.putValue(java.lang.String name,java.lang.Object value)` method is deprecated and replaced by `javax.http.HttpSession.setAttribute(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object)`

                    In a cloud environment it has to be considered that the data in the memory of a running container can be wiped out by a restart (triggered by code deploy, config change, or the execution environment relocating the process to a different physical location)[1].
                    Consider storing HTTPSession data to a cache backing service[2][3][4][5]
