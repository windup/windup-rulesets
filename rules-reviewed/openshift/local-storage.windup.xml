       This rules could be merged together but they need to be separated due to issue WINDUP-1324 [https://issues.jboss.org/projects/WINDUP/issues/WINDUP-1324] 
       This is also the reason why many messages are pretty similar.

                    Accessing a file on a local storage in a cloud environment is not safe because, inside a running container, an application can never assume that anything stored on disk will be permanently available because a restart (triggered by code deploy, config change, or the execution environment relocating the process to a different physical location) will usually wipe out all local (e.g., memory and filesystem) state.  
                    
                    There are different ways to improve the application based on what the file is used for:
                    
                    * logging: log to stdout [1] and use a centralized log collector to analyze logs [2] 
                    * caching: use a cache backing service accessed [3] via a URL or other locator/credentials stored in the config (see below) 
                    * config: store configurations in environment variables because they are easy to change between deploys without changing any code [4][5][6]
                    * storing data: use a database backing service [3] in case of relational data or a persistent storage system [7][8][9][10]
                    * temporary data: file system of a running container should be used to storing files only as a brief, single-transaction cache (e.g. downloading a large file, operating on it, and storing the results of the operation in the database)
