This directory contains default set of Windup rules distributed with RHAMT.
The name 'rules-reviewed' came from historic event of rewriting Windup 1.0 rules to Windup 2.0.

The directory structure is:

    <target-tech>/<source-tech>

For instance,

    eap7/eap5and6
    
contains rules that migrate from EAP 5 and 6 to EAP 7.

The 'api-jars' directory contains jars used to determine which API is provided by the target technology.
