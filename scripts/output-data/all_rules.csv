                       Sonic ESB services inherit from XQService.  In Camel, this can be achieved through the simple Java Bean Camel Component.

                       * [Camel Java Bean Component](http://camel.apache.org/bean.html)

                             Sonic ESB services leverage the service(XQServiceContext context) method to implement business logic.  When messages are routed to the service, the service(XQServiceContext context) method is executed.
                             In Camel, this is achieved by routing messages to the Java Bean via the Camel Route's Bean Component syntax.

                             * [Camel Java Bean Component](http://camel.apache.org/bean.html)
                             * [Camel Binding Annotations](http://camel.apache.org/parameter-binding-annotations.html)

                             Camel's Java Bean Component can leverage annotations annotations on the method to specify how Camel Message body values are mapped to the method parameters.  Additionally, the @Handler annotation can be leveraged to setup the default Java Bean method.

                             **For example:**

                             ```java
                             public void service(XQServiceContext ctx) throws XQServiceException \{
                                 ...
                             }
                             ```

                             **Should become:**

                             ```java
                             @Handler
                             public void service(@Header messageHeader, @Body messageBody, Exchange exchange) \{

                        the `jvmRoute` is set to the same value as the server name.
                        If you need to customize it, you can use a command like the following.
                        Replace or remove the `/profile=ha portion` of the command, depending on which profile you use or
                        whether you use a standalone server.
                        Replace the string `CUSTOM_ROUTE_NAME` with your custom jvmRoute name.

                        ```
                        /profile=ha/subsystem=web:write-attribute(name=""instance-id"", value=""CUSTOM_ROUTE_NAME"")
                        ```

                        The default can be overriden by setting the `jvmRoute` system property.

            Numbers and dates are now indexed as numeric fields by default. Properties of type int, long, float, double, and their
            corresponding wrapper classes are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, they are now indexed using Lucene’s appropriate numeric
            encoding. The id fields are an exception to this rule. Even when they are represented by a numeric type, they are still indexed as
            a string keyword by default. The use of `@NumericField` is now obsolete unless you want to specify a custom precision for the numeric
            encoding. You can keep the old string-based index format by explicitly specifying a string encoding field bridge. In the case of
            integers, this is the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin.IntegerBridge`. Check the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin` package for
            other publicly available field bridges.

            Date and Calendar are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, instances are encoded as long values representing the number
            of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. You can switch the indexing format by using the new EncodingType enum. For example:

            ```java
            @DateBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            @CalendarBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            ```

            The encoding change for numbers and dates is important and can have a big impact on application behavior. If you have
            a query that targets a field that was previously string-encoded, but is now encoded numerically, you must update the query. Numeric
             fields must be searched with a NumericRangeQuery. You must also make sure that all fields targeted by faceting are string encoded.
            If you use the Search query DSL, the correct query should be created automatically for you.

                       Sonic ESB services inherit from XQService.  In Camel, this can be achieved through the simple Java Bean Camel Component.

                             In Camel, this is achieved by routing messages to the Java Bean via the Camel Route's Bean Component syntax.

                             Camel's Java Bean Component can leverage annotations annotations on the method to specify how Camel Message body values are mapped to the method parameters.  Additionally, the @Handler annotation can be leveraged to setup the default Java Bean method.

                             **For example:**

                             ```java

                             ```

                             **Should become:**

            Numbers and dates are now indexed as numeric fields by default. Properties of type int, long, float, double, and their
            corresponding wrapper classes are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, they are now indexed using Lucene’s appropriate numeric
            encoding. The id fields are an exception to this rule. Even when they are represented by a numeric type, they are still indexed as
            a string keyword by default. The use of `@NumericField` is now obsolete unless you want to specify a custom precision for the numeric
            encoding. You can keep the old string-based index format by explicitly specifying a string encoding field bridge. In the case of
            integers, this is the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin.IntegerBridge`. Check the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin` package for
            other publicly available field bridges.

            Date and Calendar are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, instances are encoded as long values representing the number
            of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. You can switch the indexing format by using the new EncodingType enum. For example:

            ```java
            @DateBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            @CalendarBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            ```

            The encoding change for numbers and dates is important and can have a big impact on application behavior. If you have
            a query that targets a field that was previously string-encoded, but is now encoded numerically, you must update the query. Numeric
             fields must be searched with a NumericRangeQuery. You must also make sure that all fields targeted by faceting are string encoded.
            If you use the Search query DSL, the correct query should be created automatically for you.

                            container tests to store a message with some form of logging - to a file, JMX, etc. TestMessageStore is used throughout
                            the JBoss ESB sample projects to help test the results of processed messages.

                            Fuse Service Works is able to leverage Arquillian to do container testing, so TestMessageStore is not
                            necessary for testing. This action should simply be removed during the migration.

                            JBoss ESB uses notifiers to transform ESB aware messages to a format that ESB-unaware services can handle. Fuse Service Works uses bi-directional gateways to transfer messages

                       Sonic ESB services inherit from XQService.  In Camel, this can be achieved through the simple Java Bean Camel Component.

                       * [Camel Java Bean Component](http://camel.apache.org/bean.html)

                             Sonic ESB services leverage the service(XQServiceContext context) method to implement business logic.  When messages are routed to the service, the service(XQServiceContext context) method is executed.
                             In Camel, this is achieved by routing messages to the Java Bean via the Camel Route's Bean Component syntax.

                             * [Camel Java Bean Component](http://camel.apache.org/bean.html)
                             * [Camel Binding Annotations](http://camel.apache.org/parameter-binding-annotations.html)

                             Camel's Java Bean Component can leverage annotations annotations on the method to specify how Camel Message body values are mapped to the method parameters.  Additionally, the @Handler annotation can be leveraged to setup the default Java Bean method.

                             **For example:**

                             ```java
                             public void service(XQServiceContext ctx) throws XQServiceException \{
                                 ...
                             }
                             ```

                             **Should become:**

                             ```java
                             @Handler
                             public void service(@Header messageHeader, @Body messageBody, Exchange exchange) \{
                                 ...
                             }
                             ```

The old and new applications must be running on the same server or cluster. The new version of the application accepts new web session requests while the older version finishes processing requests already in process. Upon completion of the existing session requests, the older version of the application is then undeployed.
                        In JBoss EAP, you can either deploy the new application to a secondary server group or cluster, or deploy the new application serially to the same clustered domain.

            Numbers and dates are now indexed as numeric fields by default. Properties of type int, long, float, double, and their
            corresponding wrapper classes are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, they are now indexed using Lucene’s appropriate numeric
            encoding. The id fields are an exception to this rule. Even when they are represented by a numeric type, they are still indexed as
            a string keyword by default. The use of `@NumericField` is now obsolete unless you want to specify a custom precision for the numeric
            encoding. You can keep the old string-based index format by explicitly specifying a string encoding field bridge. In the case of
            integers, this is the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin.IntegerBridge`. Check the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin` package for
            other publicly available field bridges.

            Date and Calendar are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, instances are encoded as long values representing the number
            of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. You can switch the indexing format by using the new EncodingType enum. For example:

            ```java
            @DateBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            @CalendarBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            ```

            The encoding change for numbers and dates is important and can have a big impact on application behavior. If you have
            a query that targets a field that was previously string-encoded, but is now encoded numerically, you must update the query. Numeric
             fields must be searched with a NumericRangeQuery. You must also make sure that all fields targeted by faceting are string encoded.
            If you use the Search query DSL, the correct query should be created automatically for you.

                       Sonic ESB services inherit from XQService.  In Camel, this can be achieved through the simple Java Bean Camel Component.

                             In Camel, this is achieved by routing messages to the Java Bean via the Camel Route's Bean Component syntax.

                             **For example:**

                             ```java

                             ```

                             **Should become:**

                        It does this by appending the name of the JVM to the `JSESSIONID` of the request,

                        Replace or remove the `/profile=ha portion` of the command, depending on which profile you use or
                        whether you use a standalone server.

            Numbers and dates are now indexed as numeric fields by default. Properties of type int, long, float, double, and their
            corresponding wrapper classes are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, they are now indexed using Lucene’s appropriate numeric
            encoding. The id fields are an exception to this rule. Even when they are represented by a numeric type, they are still indexed as
            a string keyword by default. The use of `@NumericField` is now obsolete unless you want to specify a custom precision for the numeric
            encoding. You can keep the old string-based index format by explicitly specifying a string encoding field bridge. In the case of
            integers, this is the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin.IntegerBridge`. Check the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin` package for
            other publicly available field bridges.

            Date and Calendar are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, instances are encoded as long values representing the number
            of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. You can switch the indexing format by using the new EncodingType enum. For example:

            ```java
            @DateBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            @CalendarBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            ```

            The encoding change for numbers and dates is important and can have a big impact on application behavior. If you have
            a query that targets a field that was previously string-encoded, but is now encoded numerically, you must update the query. Numeric
             fields must be searched with a NumericRangeQuery. You must also make sure that all fields targeted by faceting are string encoded.
            If you use the Search query DSL, the correct query should be created automatically for you.

                       Sonic ESB services inherit from XQService.  In Camel, this can be achieved through the simple Java Bean Camel Component.

                             Sonic ESB services leverage the service(XQServiceContext context) method to implement business logic.  When messages are routed to the service, the service(XQServiceContext context) method is executed.
                             In Camel, this is achieved by routing messages to the Java Bean via the Camel Route's Bean Component syntax.

                             Camel's Java Bean Component can leverage annotations annotations on the method to specify how Camel Message body values are mapped to the method parameters.  Additionally, the @Handler annotation can be leveraged to setup the default Java Bean method.

            Numbers and dates are now indexed as numeric fields by default. Properties of type int, long, float, double, and their
            corresponding wrapper classes are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, they are now indexed using Lucene’s appropriate numeric
            encoding. The id fields are an exception to this rule. Even when they are represented by a numeric type, they are still indexed as
            a string keyword by default. The use of `@NumericField` is now obsolete unless you want to specify a custom precision for the numeric
            encoding. You can keep the old string-based index format by explicitly specifying a string encoding field bridge. In the case of
            integers, this is the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin.IntegerBridge`. Check the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin` package for
            other publicly available field bridges.

            Date and Calendar are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, instances are encoded as long values representing the number
            of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. You can switch the indexing format by using the new EncodingType enum. For example:

            ```java
            @DateBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            @CalendarBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            ```

            The encoding change for numbers and dates is important and can have a big impact on application behavior. If you have
            a query that targets a field that was previously string-encoded, but is now encoded numerically, you must update the query. Numeric
             fields must be searched with a NumericRangeQuery. You must also make sure that all fields targeted by faceting are string encoded.
            If you use the Search query DSL, the correct query should be created automatically for you.

                       Sonic ESB services inherit from XQService.  In Camel, this can be achieved through the simple Java Bean Camel Component.

                             In Camel, this is achieved by routing messages to the Java Bean via the Camel Route's Bean Component syntax.

                             Camel's Java Bean Component can leverage annotations annotations on the method to specify how Camel Message body values are mapped to the method parameters.  Additionally, the @Handler annotation can be leveraged to setup the default Java Bean method.

                             **For example:**

                             ```java

                             }
                             ```

                             **Should become:**

                             ```java

                        In JBoss Web, the `jvmRoute` attribute of the Engine element allows the load balancer to match requests
                        to the JVM currently responsible for updating the relevant session.
                        It does this by appending the name of the JVM to the `JSESSIONID` of the request,
                        and matching this against the worker name provided in `workers.properites`.

                        the `jvmRoute` is set to the same value as the server name.
                        If you need to customize it, you can use a command like the following.
                        Replace or remove the `/profile=ha portion` of the command, depending on which profile you use or
                        whether you use a standalone server.

            Numbers and dates are now indexed as numeric fields by default. Properties of type int, long, float, double, and their
            corresponding wrapper classes are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, they are now indexed using Lucene’s appropriate numeric
            encoding. The id fields are an exception to this rule. Even when they are represented by a numeric type, they are still indexed as
            a string keyword by default. The use of `@NumericField` is now obsolete unless you want to specify a custom precision for the numeric
            encoding. You can keep the old string-based index format by explicitly specifying a string encoding field bridge. In the case of
            integers, this is the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin.IntegerBridge`. Check the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin` package for
            other publicly available field bridges.

            Date and Calendar are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, instances are encoded as long values representing the number
            of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. You can switch the indexing format by using the new EncodingType enum. For example:

            ```java
            @DateBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            @CalendarBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            ```

            The encoding change for numbers and dates is important and can have a big impact on application behavior. If you have
            a query that targets a field that was previously string-encoded, but is now encoded numerically, you must update the query. Numeric
             fields must be searched with a NumericRangeQuery. You must also make sure that all fields targeted by faceting are string encoded.
            If you use the Search query DSL, the correct query should be created automatically for you.

                            JBoss ESB uses notifiers to transform ESB aware messages to a format that ESB-unaware services can handle. Fuse Service Works uses bi-directional gateways to transfer messages
                            via its service bindings.

                            A JBoss ESB Notifier should be converted to a Fuse Service Works Service Binding.

                       Sonic ESB services leverage the service(XQServiceContext context) method to implement business logic.  When messages are routed to the service, the service(XQServiceContext context) method is executed.
                       In Camel, this is achieved by routing messages to the Java Bean via the Camel Route's Bean Component syntax.

                       Camel's Java Bean Component can leverage annotations annotations on the method to specify how Camel Message body values are mapped to the method parameters.  Additionally, the @Handler annotation can be leveraged to setup the default Java Bean method.

                       **For example:**

                       ```java

                        In JBoss Web, the `jvmRoute` attribute of the Engine element allows the load balancer to match requests
                        to the JVM currently responsible for updating the relevant session.
                        It does this by appending the name of the JVM to the `JSESSIONID` of the request,
                        and matching this against the worker name provided in `workers.properites`.

                        In JBoss EAP 6,
                        the `jvmRoute` is set to the same value as the server name.
                        If you need to customize it, you can use a command like the following.
                        Replace or remove the `/profile=ha portion` of the command, depending on which profile you use or
                        whether you use a standalone server.
                        Replace the string `CUSTOM_ROUTE_NAME` with your custom jvmRoute name.

                        ```
                        /profile=ha/subsystem=web:write-attribute(name=""instance-id"", value=""CUSTOM_ROUTE_NAME"")
                        ```

                        The default can be overriden by setting the `jvmRoute` system property.

            Numbers and dates are now indexed as numeric fields by default. Properties of type int, long, float, double, and their
            corresponding wrapper classes are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, they are now indexed using Lucene’s appropriate numeric
            encoding. The id fields are an exception to this rule. Even when they are represented by a numeric type, they are still indexed as
            a string keyword by default. The use of `@NumericField` is now obsolete unless you want to specify a custom precision for the numeric
            encoding. You can keep the old string-based index format by explicitly specifying a string encoding field bridge. In the case of
            integers, this is the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin.IntegerBridge`. Check the `org.hibernate.search.bridge.builtin` package for
            other publicly available field bridges.

            Date and Calendar are no longer indexed as strings. Instead, instances are encoded as long values representing the number
            of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. You can switch the indexing format by using the new EncodingType enum. For example:

            ```java
            @DateBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            @CalendarBridge(encoding=EncodingType.STRING)
            ```

            The encoding change for numbers and dates is important and can have a big impact on application behavior. If you have
            a query that targets a field that was previously string-encoded, but is now encoded numerically, you must update the query. Numeric
             fields must be searched with a NumericRangeQuery. You must also make sure that all fields targeted by faceting are string encoded.
            If you use the Search query DSL, the correct query should be created automatically for you.
